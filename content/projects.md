## Model Predictive Congestion Control

This project aims to investigate how to apply model predictive control theory
to TCP based congestion control.
Research has focused on a delay based approach using rate pacing.
Some results have been presented at the
[2019 Workshop on Buffer Sizing](http://buffer-workshop.stanford.edu/).
These results and more can also be found in an arXiv paper (1).
